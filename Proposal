Proposal
==========
Animation:
	Purpose: To elegantly update sprites for gameplay. The animations should be clear to understand, sharp and smooth. Also, animations should be generic, easily re-used, and adabtable. 

	How it links to other sections: 
		Game mechanics is essentially going to dictate how animation works. 
		Examples: how text screens work, where should they appear
				 how fast should the character walk across the map

		other section also need to easily interact with Animation.
		Examples: Coordinate on map where events for should take place
				  Placement of items/east bunnies

	Requirements inorder for Animation to function:
		Generic map that marks collision areas, and sets a finite coordinate system on the map.
		a player, represented by a rectangle to animate on generic map.

		with these , even if all art assets are lost, animation can keep its functionality. Also, other sections arn't affected as well

	Planning:
		A. Making player moveable on map.
		B. Making player unable to move on certain tiles
		C. Generic text animation that take input and elegantly presents 	it on screen *game mechanics*
		D. Pause Screen *game mechanics*
		E. Easily switch map/screens.
		F. all minigames and alterior generic maps 
		*changes as game develops and not yet planned at all*

	Art: *because of sheer time commitment, it has been moved to a section of its own*
		Purpose: Make the game gorgeous, consent, and simple. Can make/break the game, truly key.

	Planing:
		1. NPCs/Player creation
		2. TILE map creation
			***GENERIC MAPS FIRST, so animation can function.
			-must be flexible tiles that easily work together to make a really elegent map
			-a finite definite list of all tiles needed
			-need to be spaced and carefully planned. There is a massive amount of tiles that need to be created since we chose to make these.
		3. improve Animations that work with game mechanics, 
				such as pause/text screen
