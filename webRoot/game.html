    <p>I made this sample startup screen pretty quickly and easily. It will ask you if you give it permission to run but I just recently read that <a href="http://blogs.unity3d.com/2014/04/29/on-the-future-of-web-publishing-in-unity/">Unity 5</a> (release later this year)</p>
    <p>will make it so you don't have to even give it permission. It is integrated with WebGL</p>
